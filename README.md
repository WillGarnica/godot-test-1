# Godot Test 1 - My First 2D Character

A simple Godot 4.5 project featuring a basic 2D character controller. This is a beginner-friendly project to learn Godot fundamentals.

## 📁 Project Structure

This project follows modern Godot best practices with organized folder structure:

```

### 🏗️ **Why This Structure?**
- **Scalable**: Easy to add new characters, levels, and features
- **Team-Friendly**: Designers and programmers can work independently
- **Industry Standard**: Follows professional game development practices
- **Maintainable**: Easy to find and organize files as project grows
- **Clean Root**: All source code organized under `src/` directory
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear distinction between source code and project configuration
- **Professional**: Mirrors industry-standard project organization patterns

## 🎮 How to Play

- **Arrow Keys** or **WASD**: Move the character
- **Multiple directions**: Hold multiple keys for diagonal movement

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Player.gd Script Features:
- **Type Safety**: Uses proper type hints (`float`, `Vector2`, `void`)
- **Movement System**: 8-directional movement with normalized diagonal speed
- **Physics Integration**: Uses `CharacterBody2D` and `move_and_slide()`
- **Input Handling**: Responsive keyboard input detection
- **Export Variables**: Speed can be adjusted in the Godot inspector

### Scene Structure:
- **`src/scenes/main/Main.tscn`**: Root scene containing the player instance
- **`src/scenes/player/Player.tscn`**: Modular player character with:
  - `CharacterBody2D` (root) - Physics body with attached script
  - `ColorRect` (PlayerSprite) - Visual representation (blue square)
  - `CollisionShape2D` (PlayerCollision) - Collision detection shape

### File Organization:
- **Scenes (.tscn)**: Organized in `src/scenes/` by functionality
- **Scripts (.gd)**: Organized in `src/scripts/` matching scene structure
- **Assets**: Centralized in `src/assets/` for easy resource management
- **UI Resources**: Icons and UI elements in `src/ui/`
- **Project Config**: Root-level configuration files (`.godot`, `.gitignore`, etc.)

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Open Godot Engine** (4.5 or later)
2. **Import this project** by selecting the `project.godot` file
3. **Main scene is pre-configured** (`src/scenes/main/Main.tscn`)
4. **Press F5** or click the Play button to run the game
5. **Use arrow keys or WASD** to move the blue square character around

### 🎯 **Expected Behavior:**
- Blue square character appears in the center of the screen
- Smooth 8-directional movement with consistent speed
- Character stops immediately when no keys are pressed

## 🗂️ **Project Organization Benefits**

### **Clean Architecture:**
- **`src/` Directory**: All source code centralized in one location
- **Separation of Concerns**: Source code vs. project configuration clearly separated
- **Scalable Structure**: Easy to add new features without cluttering the root directory

### **Professional Standards:**
- **Industry Best Practice**: Mirrors how professional game studios organize projects
- **Team Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work without file conflicts
- **Version Control**: Clean Git history with organized file structure
- **Build Systems**: Easier integration with CI/CD and automated build processes

## 📚 Learning Concepts Covered

### 🎓 **Godot Fundamentals:**
- **Node System**: Understanding Godot's hierarchical node structure
- **Scenes**: Creating modular and reusable scene components
- **Scripts**: Attaching GDScript behavior to nodes
- **Project Organization**: Professional folder structure and file management

### 🎮 **Game Development:**
- **Input System**: Handling keyboard input with `Input.is_action_pressed()`
- **Physics**: Character movement using `CharacterBody2D` and `move_and_slide()`
- **Vector Math**: Using `Vector2` for position and movement calculations
- **Export Variables**: Making script properties configurable in the inspector

### 💻 **Code Quality:**
- **Type Safety**: Proper type hints (`float`, `Vector2`, `void`)
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive code comments and explanations
- **Best Practices**: Following Godot coding conventions and standards

## 🎯 Next Steps

This foundational project can be expanded with:

### 🎨 **Visual Improvements:**
- Replace ColorRect with actual sprite animations
